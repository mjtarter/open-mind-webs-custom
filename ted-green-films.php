$description = "An Indianapolis based film producer, Ted Green Films has been awarded 8 Regional Emmys for their documentaries. For this project the client designed the site and gave me rough sketches of the layout. I was also given the images, text, and videos to be used for the site. I then used this information to develop a website that provides online marketing for their documentaries, recent news, previews, reviews, awards, bios, dvd purchases, and much more.";
