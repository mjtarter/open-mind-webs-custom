$description = "The Only is a sports exhibition hall that consists of thousands of historical sports pieces and memorabilia. For this project the client needed an organized database to display their entire inventory. I photographed each individual item and created the database and website to the right. It consists of search criteria including key word search to find specific items. It also allows the manager to add and delete items from the database. With the power of this database, the owner as well as customers can easily sift through and view all products that The Only has to offer.";
