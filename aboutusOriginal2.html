<h3 style="text-align:center;">Who We Are</h3>
We are not a web development company but rather a network of freelance developers and designers brought together to provide a wider variety of services at half the price. Our goal is to allow smaller companies and individuals to obtain their dream website that they never thought they'd be able to acquire.
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">How We Operate</h3>
   
Freelancers are the solution when an individual or business wants more than a cheap web builder template site but less than going through the process and prices of a web development firm. However, good freelancers can be hard to find, are often unreliable, and are limited in scope so you may need to hire more than one. Open Mind Webs is efficient because we are a group of proven freelancers working together. We can provide a variety of services for one price and eliminate the risk of using an unknown freelancer.
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Why We Are Successful</h3>
We have the experience and the will to help you attain your dream website. Our team members have worked on a variety of projects both large and small. A few of them include designing for Callaway Golf Company and web development for 3-time Emmy Award winning film producer Ted Green Films, Inc. We have also created personal photography websites, E-commerce sites, and a database management system to help a sports memoribilia business keep track of inventory.

Photography is a hobby of his and he wanted a website to display and sell some of his work. He was given an estimate of over $6,000. This is what sparked the idea behind this organization. We are the web development solution that makes it a reality for the average person to obtain a professional website."</p>

<div class="CompanyComparison">



<h2 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:40px;"> We fill the void between free web builders and web development companies.</h2>

<div class="Template">
<p style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px;"><b>Free Templates / Web Builders</b></p>
These resources allow you to “build your own website in minutes.” Unfortunately, what sounds too good to be true usually is. This is a good option for individuals with extremely low budgets looking for the most basic form of a website. You must build your own site and customization is limited.
</div>
<div class="omw">
<p style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px;"><b>Open Mind Webs</b></p>
We are ideal for those that do not want a cheap looking web builder site but do not want to go through the process and prices of a web development company. We do not see ourselves as competitors to either of these two options but rather as capturing a market that would otherwise not be able to receive quality web services without us.
</div>
<div class="webcompany">
<p style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px;"><b>Web Companies</b></p>
Most web companies will provide good quality and services. Their services are ideal for large businesses and those that are in need of a top notch website as well as an in depth marketing plan and strategy. They can also help smaller companies and individuals but often at prices above your budget.
