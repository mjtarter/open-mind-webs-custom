They came to me with the need for a DBMS to assist them with organizing, updating, storing, and maintaining products from their Party Pail line of consumer products. The database I created stores all of their products with detailed information (spanning 50+ columns per product) that can be uploaded in an excel spreadsheet format.  In addition, I created an automated system for rapidly mass altering product descriptions for search engine optimization for a variety of E-commerce websites. ";
