$description = "MyCampus Island is a startup of mine that is a web based student housing app for college students in the Bloomington, Indiana area. This is a large site that takes advantage of an extensive back-end database to provide in-depth individual pages for all 12 dorms, as well as a large variety of properties for lease to students in Bloomington. This is a fully responsive website equipped with search criteria that allows users to find specific housing properties that best suit their needs. I am the sole contributor to this startup so I have done everything from the web design to the back end database to the properties listed. <a href='http://www.mycampusisland.com' target='_blank'>Check it out!</a>";
