$description = "One of the top ophthalmology practices in Indiana, Abrams Eyecare has 3 offices located in central Indiana. They had an outdated website that had not been changed in years, so I redesigned and developed a more modern and “easier on the eyes” website. I developed a static website that includes approximately 40 pages, and helped Abrams Eyecare introduce their brand new patient portal.";
